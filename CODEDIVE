how clang works
----------------------------
> clang is a compiler, written in C++, good diagnostics
g++ example.cpp
clang++ example.cpp
> libclang has well designed AST, intended for building tools
wget https://github.com/llvm-mirror/clang/archive/master.zip
python clang-master/bindings/python/examples/cindex/cindex-dump.py example.cpp | less
python clang-master/bindings/python/examples/cindex/cindex-includes.py /usr/include/stdint.h | less

binding with ctypes
----------------------------
4. ctypes is a python stdlib based on libffi
5. how to open library
6. basics: simple function, global, calls count
7. strchr: call a function raw, argtypes, restype
*. custom: vector example, little hourglass

clang binding explained
----------------------------
> hourglass C-API
vim clang-master/include/clang-c/Index.h
> ctypes bound to C-API
vim clang-master/bindings/python/clang/cindex.py
> source itself
vim clang-master/bindings/python/examples/cindex/cindex-dump.py
vim clang-master/bindings/python/examples/cindex/cindex-includes.py

foo = ctypes.cdll.LoadLibrary('libfoo.so')
_ctypes.dlclose(foo._handle)

func.argtypes = item[1]

def from_param

func.restype = item[2]
func.errcheck = item[3]
